        <ul>
            <li>Tip 1: Create a budget and stick to it. Don't spend all of your money at once. Whether it's income from a job or just Birthday money, it simportanat to save at least a part of it. Investing it is a great choice but even putting it in a savings account works too.</li>
          
            <li>Tip 2: Start saving for retirement early. Ask your parenst to help you, the earlier you start the better. Above we (willsoon) have a fiance calulator which can help you calculate your return over a specific amount of time.</li>
            <li>Tip 3: Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio. (should add more this this too.)</li>
